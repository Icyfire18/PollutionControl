# PollutionControl
This project consists of an Arduino Uno, motor and BMP 180 Pressure sensor. It keeps a constant check on the pollution level in Textile Industries. As dust gets accumulated ,the pressure level starts to drop indicating a rise in pollution.
It is assumed that the room pressure remains constant.
